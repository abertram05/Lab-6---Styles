                        <h3>Dishcloth</h3>
                        <p>This is the perfect beginner project to practice stitches, while crocheting rows of either single or double crochet, until it is a square.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Skills: Chains, Single or Double Crochet Stitch, Turning Chains</li>
                            <li>Materials: Yarn of your choice, a hook, scissors, needle, and stitch markers if needed</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        <h3>Granny Square</h3>
                        <p>This is one of the most basic beginner projects, that a lot of people start out on. You can make one square for a coaster, or make a bunch of squares and join them together to make so many projects.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Skills: Chains, Double Crochet, Slip Stitch</li>
                            <li>Materials: Yarn of your choice, a hook, scissors, needle, and stitch markers if needed</li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Blanket</h3>
                        <p>Some may think a blanket isn't a beginner project, but if you make an entire single crochet or double crochet blanket, it is the perfect way to start practicing stitches.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Skills: Chains, Single Crochet (Double or Half Double. Choose any stitch you want to practice!), Slip knot. </li>
